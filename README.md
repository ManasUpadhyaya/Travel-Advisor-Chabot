#Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot project built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning. The chatbot is trained to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.

## Features

- Greeting
- Goodbye
- Thanks
- Name
- Help
- Weather
- Age
- Chatbot
- Creator
- Default

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `app.py`: Flask application code for handling user queries and generating responses.
- `training.py`: Code for training the chatbot model.
- `index.html`: HTML and JavaScript code for the chatbot user interface.
- `accuracy.py`: File to calculate the accuracy of the chatbot model.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot locally:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `training.py` to train the chatbot model and generate the necessary data files.
3. Start the Flask application by running `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

## Model Accuracy

The accuracy of the chatbot model is approximately 79%. To test the accuracy, run `accuracy.py`.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the training data.
- Implement advanced natural language processing techniques.
- Integrate external APIs.
- Implement user authentication and personalization.
- Deploy the chatbot on a cloud platform.

## Credits

- The chatbot model was trained using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library and Keras.
- The frontend interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The project uses the Flask framework.
